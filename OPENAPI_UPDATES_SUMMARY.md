# OpenAPI Orchestrate Spec Updates Summary

## Date: October 30, 2025

## Overview
Updated `openapi_orchestrate.json` to fix the check-quality endpoint error and ensure alignment with backend implementation.

---

## Changes Made

### 1. ✅ Fixed `/api/v1/check-quality` Endpoint (CRITICAL FIX)

**Problem**: Orchestrate was getting error: `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'items'`

**Root Cause**: The `extracted_fields` parameter was marked as required, but Orchestrate was sending `null` or omitting it, causing a NoneType error in the backend.

**Solution**:
- **OpenAPI Spec (`openapi_orchestrate.json`)**:
  - Removed `"extracted_fields"` from the `required` array (line 652-656)
  - Added `"default": {}` to the `extracted_fields` property
  - Updated description to clarify it's optional

- **Backend Model (`models.py`)**:
  - Changed `QualityCheckRequest.extracted_fields` from required (`Field(...)`) to optional with default (`Field(default_factory=dict)`)

**Result**: The endpoint now accepts requests with or without `extracted_fields`, defaulting to an empty dictionary if not provided.

---

### 2. ✅ Enhanced `/api/v1/workflow-preloaded` Response Schema

**Problem**: OpenAPI spec was missing several fields that the actual `CompleteWorkflowResponse` model returns.

**Missing Fields Added**:
- `document_metadata` - Document metadata (filename, size, etc.)
- `document_type` - Type of document generated
- `iso_standard` - ISO standard followed  
- `source_document` - Original document identifier
- `timestamp` - Processing timestamp (ISO 8601 format)
- `saved_file_path` - Path to saved output file (nullable)

**Enhanced Schemas**:
- `violations` array now has complete object schema with all RuleViolation properties:
  - `rule_id`, `rule_name`, `severity`, `description`, `violation_details`, `passed`
- `recommendations` array now explicitly defines items as strings
- `extracted_fields` now uses `additionalProperties` for proper object typing

**Added Error Responses**:
- `400` - Invalid document_id
- `500` - Server error during processing

---

### 3. ✅ Added Missing `/api/v1/workflow-complete` Endpoint

**Problem**: This endpoint existed in `main.py` but was completely missing from the OpenAPI spec.

**Added Complete Endpoint Definition**:
- **Operation ID**: `workflowComplete`
- **Summary**: "Complete workflow with file upload"
- **Method**: POST with multipart/form-data
- **Request Parameters**:
  - `file` (required) - Document file to process (DOCX, PDF, etc.)
  - `iso_standard` (optional, default: "ISO 9001:2015")
  - `document_type` (optional, default: "quality_system_record")
- **Response**: Same complete schema as workflow-preloaded (CompleteWorkflowResponse)
- **Error Responses**: 400 (bad request), 500 (server error)

This endpoint is identical to `workflow-preloaded` but accepts file uploads instead of using pre-loaded documents.

---

### 4. ✅ Added "Complete Workflow" Tag

**Problem**: The `workflow-preloaded` and `workflow-complete` endpoints used the "Complete Workflow" tag, but it wasn't defined in the tags section.

**Solution**: Added tag definition to the tags array:
```json
{
  "name": "Complete Workflow",
  "description": "Complete workflow with all steps including quality checks"
}
```

---

## Files Modified

1. **`openapi_orchestrate.json`** - OpenAPI specification file
   - Fixed check-quality endpoint (made extracted_fields optional)
   - Enhanced workflow-preloaded response schema
   - Added workflow-complete endpoint
   - Added Complete Workflow tag

2. **`models.py`** - Backend Pydantic models
   - Updated QualityCheckRequest to make extracted_fields optional with default

---

## Testing Performed

### ✅ Model Validation Test
Created and ran `test_quality_check_fix.py` which verified:
- ✅ Request can be created WITHOUT extracted_fields (defaults to {})
- ✅ Request can be created WITH extracted_fields (normal use case)
- ✅ Calling `.items()` on extracted_fields works without error
- ✅ No more "NoneType" errors

### ✅ JSON Validation
- Validated `openapi_orchestrate.json` syntax with Python's json.tool
- No linter errors detected

---

## API Endpoint Summary

The OpenAPI spec now includes all 10 endpoints from `main.py`:

1. **System**:
   - `GET /health` - Health check
   - `POST /api/v1/debug-upload` - Debug file uploads

2. **Document Processing**:
   - `POST /api/v1/parse-document` - Parse document and extract text

3. **Field Extraction**:
   - `POST /api/v1/extract-fields` - Extract fields from text using AI

4. **ISO Template Generation**:
   - `POST /api/v1/generate-iso-template` - Generate ISO template

5. **Complete Processing**:
   - `GET /api/v1/list-preloaded-documents` - List available sample documents
   - `POST /api/v1/process-preloaded` - Process pre-loaded document (simple)
   - `POST /api/v1/process-complete` - Complete pipeline with file upload

6. **Complete Workflow** (NEW/UPDATED):
   - `POST /api/v1/workflow-preloaded` - Complete workflow with pre-loaded doc ⭐
   - `POST /api/v1/workflow-complete` - Complete workflow with file upload ⭐

7. **Quality Assurance**:
   - `POST /api/v1/check-quality` - Quality check (FIXED) ✅

---

## Next Steps for Deployment

1. **Re-import OpenAPI Spec to Orchestrate**:
   - Upload the updated `openapi_orchestrate.json` to watsonx Orchestrate
   - The check-quality endpoint should now work without errors
   - Both workflow endpoints will be available with complete documentation

2. **Test in Orchestrate**:
   - Test `/api/v1/workflow-preloaded` with document_id
   - Test `/api/v1/check-quality` with minimal required fields (no extracted_fields)
   - Verify all response fields are properly displayed

3. **Monitor Logs**:
   - Check for any new errors in Orchestrate
   - Validate that all response fields are being received correctly

---

## Benefits

✅ **Fixed Critical Bug**: Resolved the NoneType error in check-quality endpoint  
✅ **Complete Documentation**: All endpoints from backend are now documented  
✅ **Better Type Safety**: Enhanced schemas with proper object definitions  
✅ **Orchestrate-Friendly**: Optional parameters with sensible defaults  
✅ **Comprehensive Responses**: All response fields properly documented  
✅ **Error Handling**: Explicit error response codes (400, 500)  

---

## Backward Compatibility

✅ All changes are **backward compatible**:
- Existing API calls will continue to work
- Optional parameters have sensible defaults
- New fields in responses are additive (won't break existing consumers)
- No breaking changes to request/response structures
