# Executive Quality Check Endpoint - README

## ✅ SIMPLIFIED IMPLEMENTATION

Based on your feedback about errors with complex returns, the endpoint now returns **just one markdown string** - no complex nested objects!

## 🎯 What It Does

Takes an ISO template and returns a clean, executive-friendly markdown report with:
- Overall grade and score
- Section-by-section assessment **table**
- Critical issues (top 3-5)
- Actionable recommendations (top 3-5)

## 📍 Endpoint

**POST** `/api/v1/quality-check-executive`

## 📥 Request (Ultra-Simple!)

```json
{
  "generated_template": "Your ISO template text here..."
}
```

**That's it!** Just one string field. No optional parameters, no complex objects.

## 📤 Response

```json
{
  "quality_report": "# Executive Quality Report\n\n## Overall Assessment...",
  "success": true,
  "timestamp": "2025-10-30T10:30:00.123Z"
}
```

The `quality_report` is a single markdown string that looks like this when rendered:

# Executive Quality Report

## Overall Assessment
- **Grade:** B
- **Score:** 82.5/100
- **Compliance Status:** Needs Revision
- **Summary:** Document structure is sound but requires attention to missing information.

## Section-by-Section Assessment

| Section | Grade | Score | Status | Issues |
|---------|-------|-------|--------|--------|
| Header Information | C | 70 | ⚠️ Warning | Department field missing |
| Purpose & Scope | A | 95 | ✅ Pass | No issues found |
| Procedures | B | 85 | ✅ Pass | Minor inconsistencies |

## Critical Issues
1. Department information is missing from document header
2. Revision date is older than 2 years
3. Responsibilities section lacks specific role assignments

## Recommendations
1. Add proper department designation to document header
2. Update document to current revision
3. Replace generic role descriptions with specific assignments
